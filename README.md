# Audio-Technica-AT2020USB
How I dimmed the blue LED of the Audio-Technica AT2020USB+ to almost invisible level while preserving the original aesthetics of the microphone.

I learnt how to access to blue LED of the Audio-Technica AT2020USB+ through this video by Gizmo:

However, I found that it would better preserve the original aesthetics of the microphone if I did not remove the decorative Audio Technica branding tape. I simply tapped right into the screws using a screwdriver, breaking a small amount of tape that covered the screws.

I then found my own way to black out the LED almost totally, or even totally if you wanted to, without using any adhesive tape. I used two layers of polyolefin heat shrink tubings. The first layer is red, to absorb most of the blue light, and the seond layer is black to further absorb any residual light and give it an overall black, professional appearance. (If you want to black the LED out totally, just fold the black polyolefine heat shirnk tubing backwards and add one more layer of heat shirnk tubing to secure the fold.)

After putting all the screws back, I cut out small pieces of black stickers to conceal the broken bits of the original branding tape.

Doing all these things greatly preserved the original aesthetics of the microphone as compared to Gizmo did in his YouTube video.
